Species: Rat (Sprague Dawley, male, 9-10-week-old, 309 g)
Imaging: µCT imaging (GE eXplore CT120 scanner) of the upper airways at 50-μm isotropic resolution. 
Segmentation: upper airways segmentation based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair. 
Model: upper airways (nasal passages) down to upper trachea. 
Mesh: Hybrid prism/polyhedral volume mesh was generated in STARCCM+. The boundary layer was kept constant at 80 µm and consisted of prismatic elements. Polyhedral mesh elements constituted the core of the volume mesh. (18.7 million elements with 45.1 million nodes and 0.86 million surface facets). 
Simulation types: airflow, aerosol transport
Funding: NHLBI R01 HL073598 and NIEHS U01 ES028669
