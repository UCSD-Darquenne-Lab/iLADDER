**<u>Species</u>**: **Human** (female, 84 Yr-old, weight and height not available)

**<u>Imaging</u>**: multi-slice CT imaging of the head and torso (623-μm isotropic resolution, FOV 31.9 × 31.9 × 46.1 cm, i.e., image volume size of 512 × 512 × 739). 

**<u>Segmentation</u>**: based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair.

**<u>Model</u>**: upper airways (nasal passages or oral cavity, both available) down to several generations of conducting airways (9 ± 2 airway generations, 135 outlets). A cylinder capturing the contours of the face and extending several centimeters away from the face is included with the distal end of the cylinder used to initiate airflows and chemical exposures. 

**<u>Mesh</u>**: polyhedral mesh created in OpenFOAM

**<u>Simulation types</u>**: airflow, vapor exposure

**<u>Funding</u>**: NHLBI R01 HL073598 and NIEHS P01 ES011617
