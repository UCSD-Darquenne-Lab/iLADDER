**<u>Human</u>** (male, 35 Yr-old, 68 kg, 1.70 m tall)<br>**<u>Imaging</u>**: multi-slice CT imaging of the head and torso (0.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm resolution, FOV 36 × 36 × 48 cm, i.e., image volume size of 512 × 512 × 960). <br/>**<u>Segmentation</u>**: based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair. In Kabilan et al’s study (2016), the larynx was widened from the as-imaged supine breath-hold position to a fully open geometry to mimic inhalation in an upright posture. Additional modifications of the oral cavity, i.e., repositioning surface of the tongue for upright oral breathing and closing off the connection to the esophagus, were made in the model used in Corley et al.’s study (2021). <br/>**<u>Models</u>**: 1) Nose down to trachea. 2) Oral cavity down to several generations of conducting airways (272 outlets). Oral model pending.<br>**Mesh**: Hybrid prism/polyhedral volume meshes generated in STAR-CCM+ (Version 8.02 for the nasal breathing model (2.85 million elements).<br/>**<u>Simulation types</u>**: airflow and aerosol transport<br/>Funding: NHLBI R01HL073598 and NIEHS U01 ES028669<br/>**<u>Related publications</u>**: [Corley et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfab062)
