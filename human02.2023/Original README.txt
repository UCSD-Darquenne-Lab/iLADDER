STLs and Mesh for the '4 Runs Paper', hopefully coming out 2023.

4th_Gen_Entire_V1.stl is the source STL mesh file with no extrusion of
outlets.  

polyMesh is the OpenFOAM volume mesh which has 12,565,021 cells.  (Mostly hexes and
tets.)

PD01_2022_0.stl is the extracted surface mesh from the volume mesh which has
extrusion of outlets for stable CFD simulation.  It also has the two lung and one tubing patches.

All have meter scale.
