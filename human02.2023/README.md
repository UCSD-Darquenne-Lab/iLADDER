**<u>Human</u>** (male, 35 Yr-old, 68 kg, 1.70 m tall) Imaging: multi-slice CT imaging of the head and torso (0.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm resolution, **<u>Imaging</u>**: FOV 36 × 36 × 48 cm, i.e., image volume size of 512 × 512 × 960). 

**<u>Segmentation:</u>** based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair. See Kuprat et al. (2021) for detailed description of segmentation.

**<u>Models:</u>** Oral cavity down to ~3 generations of conducting airways (11 outlets). Model also include experimental tubing between the particle counter and mouth.

**<u>Mesh:</u>** Hybrid prism/polyhedral volume meshes generated in STAR-CCM+ (~12 million elements).

**<u>Simulation parameters:</u>** tidal volume = ~1,000ml, flow rates = ~0.3 and ~0.75L/s, particle size: 1and 2.9 µm 

**<u>Simulation types:</u>** airflow and aerosol transport
