Human (male, 35 Yr-old, 68 kg, 1.70 m tall) Imaging: multi-slice CT imaging of the head and torso (0.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm resolution, FOV 36 × 36 × 48 cm, i.e., image volume size of 512 × 512 × 960). Segmentation: based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair. See Kuprat et al. (2021) for detailed description of segmentation.

Models: Oral cavity down to ~3 generations of conducting airways (11 outlets). Model also include experimental tubing between the particle counter and mouth.

Mesh: Hybrid prism/polyhedral volume meshes generated in STAR-CCM+ (~12 million elements).

Simulation parameters: tidal volume = ~1,000ml, flow rates = ~0.3 and ~0.75L/s, particle size: 1and 2.9 µm Simulation types: airflow and aerosol transport Funding: NIEHS U01 ES028669 Related publications: Kuprat et al., 2023
