**<u>Species</u>**: Human (male, 35 Yr-old, 68 kg, 1.70 m tall)

**<u>Imaging</u>**: multi-slice CT imaging of the head and torso (0.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm resolution, FOV 36 × 36 × 48 cm, i.e., image volume size of 512 × 512 × 960). 

**<u>Segmentation</u>**: based on intensity thresholding followed by visual validation and repair. Larynx was widened from the as-imaged supine breath-hold position to a fully open geometry to mimic inhalation in an upright posture. 

**<u>Model</u>**: Nose down to several generations of conducting airways (272 outlets). Model is provided in 5 stl files as listed in the figure.

**<u>Mesh</u>**: Hybrid prism/polyhedral volume meshes generated in STARCCM+ (Version 8.02, 5,751,626 nodes and 2,550,285 polyhedral elements)

**<u>Simulation types</u>**: airflow and aerosol transport

**<u>Funding</u>**: NHLBI R01HL073598
